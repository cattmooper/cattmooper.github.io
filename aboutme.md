subtitle: What do I offer?

I'm Matt Cooper, and my professional experience looks like this:

- Hold an MEng in Aerospace Engineering with a Year in Industry from the University of Sheffield

- Experience as a consultant at one of the Big 4, working on a breadth of data-heavy projects

- Moved into the public sector, where I first worked as a data scientist in regulation

- Currently working as a Senior Data Scientist for a government organisation

However, this website is here to showcase what I do outside of work. I'm passionate about data, and specifically how it can be applied in sports, particularly football. At the time of writing, advanced analytics in football is a burgeoning area which is beginning to catch up to the levels of usage of analytics in American sports.

Ultimately I want this blog to show:
- My capability in sports analytics, delivering some interesting insights where possible
- My passion for data viz, with some great examples of how effective visualisation can be the slam dunk you need to demonstrating an idea
- My journey of self-education - I'm very interested in sports analytics, but I recognise that my skills are very much in their formative years!
